  <h1> About PrivacyDev</h1>
  <p>
    Inspired by <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org">Privacy Guides</a>, PrivacyDev is a platform designed specifically for developers who want to prioritize privacy. We curate privacy best practices and recommendations for tools, frameworks, and libraries with strong privacy protections. Our mission is to provide technically sound insights and guidance to help developers design and build software that respects user privacy.

  <p>
    We are <a href="https://www.haojianj.in/datasmith.html">Data Smith Lab</a> from <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/">HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Institute, UCSD</a>. We study the <span class="highlightred">privacy and security</span> of data systems by 
    researching the people who <span class="highlightred">design</span>, <span class="highlightred">implement</span>, and <span class="highlightred">use</span> these systems.  
  </p>
  <p>  
    We take an interdisciplinary approach to address privacy and security problems, drawing on ideas and methods from Human-Computer Interaction, Software Engineering, AI, Mobile Computing, Programming Language, and Cyber-physical Systems.
