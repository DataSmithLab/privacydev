- **[Passage](https://passage.id/)**: Passwordless authentication that reduces data collection
- **[Auth0 Passwordless](https://auth0.com/passwordless)**: Enterprise passwordless solutions
- **[Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)**: Google's authentication with privacy controls

### Self-Hosted Identity Management
- **[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)**: Open-source identity and access management
- **[Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth)**: Open-source authentication with minimal data requirements
- **[Ory](https://www.ory.sh/)**: Cloud-native identity and access infrastructure
- **[FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/)**: Customer identity platform with privacy controls

## Enterprise Solutions

- **[SelfKey](https://selfkey.org/)**: Self-sovereign identity platform

### Biometric Authentication
- **[Touch ID/Face ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication)**: Apple's biometric authentication APIs
- **[Android Biometric](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/biometric-prompt)**: Android biometric authentication framework
- **[Windows Hello](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/)**: Microsoft's biometric authentication

## Implementation Guidelines

### Privacy-First Authentication
1. **Minimize data collection** - Only collect necessary identity information
2. **Local biometric storage** - Keep biometric data on device when possible
3. **Strong encryption** - Use proper encryption for stored credentials
4. **Session management** - Implement secure session handling

### Security Best Practices
- **Use strong authentication factors** - Multi-factor authentication recommended
- **Implement proper logout** - Clear sessions and tokens completely
- **Regular security audits** - Test authentication flows regularly
- **Monitor for anomalies** - Detect unusual authentication patterns

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR Article 25** - Privacy by design in authentication systems
- **CCPA** - User rights regarding identity data
- **SOX compliance** - For financial applications
- **HIPAA** - Additional requirements for healthcare applications
