## :material-alert-circle: Important Notes

!!! warning "Security vs Privacy"
    Security protects data from unauthorized access. Privacy protects users from unwanted surveillance. You need both.

!!! tip "Start Simple"
    Begin with basic encryption and privacy-preserving analytics. Add more sophisticated tools as your needs grow.

!!! note "Regulatory Compliance"
    Privacy laws vary by jurisdiction. Consult legal experts for compliance requirements in your region.

**Remember**: Privacy engineering is not a one-time task—it's an ongoing process that evolves with your application and regulatory requirements.
