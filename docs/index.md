## Why Privacy Engineering Matters

> "We'll add privacy later" — Every failed startup

**Privacy isn't a feature—it's a foundation.** In today's regulatory landscape with GDPR, CCPA, and emerging privacy laws, privacy violations can cost millions in fines and destroy user trust overnight. ==Building privacy into your application from day one isn't just ethical—it's essential for business survival.==

Users are increasingly privacy-conscious. They choose apps that respect their data, and abandon those that don't. **Privacy is your competitive advantage.**

## Start Building Private

> Privacy by design, not by accident

**Every line of code you write is a privacy decision.** From choosing the right encryption library to implementing proper data minimization, privacy engineering requires intentional choices at every step. The good news? You don't need to reinvent the wheel.

==Learn the patterns, tools, and techniques that make privacy engineering straightforward and effective.==
