</div>
</div>

<h4><span class="pg-orange">‚ö†Ô∏è Data Training Varies by Tier</span></h4>

For **Copilot Individual** users, your code prompts and suggestions **are collected and may be used to train and improve the models** by default. You must manually opt-out in your GitHub settings. For **Copilot Business** and **Enterprise** customers, code prompts are **never** used for training and are deleted immediately after a response is generated.

<h4><span class="pg-green">‚úÖ Strong Compliance (Business Tier)</span></h4>

The **Copilot Business** and **Enterprise** tiers are designed for corporate environments. They are compliant with **SOC 2 Type 2**, **ISO 27001**, and can support **HIPAA** compliance via a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). This makes it a trusted choice for companies in regulated industries.

<h4><span class="pg-red">‚ùå Cloud-Only Deployment</span></h4>

GitHub Copilot is a cloud-only service. There is no option for on-premise or self-hosted deployment. All code processing happens on Microsoft Azure's servers.

<h4><span class="pg-green">‚úÖ IP Indemnification</span></h4>

For paying customers, Microsoft offers a **Copilot Copyright Commitment**. This means if you are sued for copyright infringement over code generated by Copilot, Microsoft will defend you and pay any damages, assuming you used their filters and didn't intentionally generate infringing code. This transfers significant legal risk from the developer to Microsoft.

### Cursor

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 16px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 4px;">

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Cursor</strong> is a powerful, AI-first code editor forked from VS Code. It is designed for a deep, conversational coding experience, but relies on third-party cloud models for its intelligence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
<a href="https://cursor.sh" style="display: inline-block; padding: 8px 16px; background-color: #4caf50; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; margin-right: 10px;">üè† Homepage</a>
<a href="https://cursor.sh/privacy">üëÅÔ∏è Privacy Policy</a> &nbsp;
<a href="https://cursor.sh/docs">‚ÑπÔ∏è Documentation</a>
</div>
</div>

<h4><span class="pg-orange">‚ö†Ô∏è Data Sent to Third-Party Models</span></h4>

By default, Cursor sends your code snippets to third-party model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to generate responses. While Cursor itself has a privacy policy, your data is also subject to the policies of the underlying model provider you choose.

<h4><span class="pg-green">‚úÖ Privacy Mode</span></h4>

Cursor offers a "Privacy Mode" for both free and Pro users. When enabled, it is guranteed that code data is never stored by their model providers or used for training. However, this feature is disabled by defualt, and would involves sending your code to the cloud for processing. Data is still retained for a short period (e.g., 30 days) for abuse monitoring by the model provider.


<h4><span class="pg-red">‚ùå No Self-Hosting or Compliance Audits</span></h4>

Cursor is a cloud-dependent editor. It cannot be run in a fully on-premise or self-hosted environment. As of late 2023, it does not hold major security certifications like SOC 2, making it a difficult choice for enterprises with strict compliance needs.

### Claude Code (Anthropic)

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 16px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
<div style="overflow: hidden;">

<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/security">üîí Trust & Safety</a>
</div>
</div>

#### <span class="pg-green">‚úÖ No Training on API Data by Default</span>

This is Anthropic's key differentiator. They have a clear policy of **not training their models on any data submitted via their business API**. Your prompts and code are only used to generate a response and are not incorporated into their models. This is the default behavior and does not require a special subscription tier.

#### <span class="pg-green">‚úÖ Enterprise-Ready Compliance</span>

Anthropic is **SOC 2 Type II** compliant and will sign a **BAA** to support **HIPAA** compliance. This makes it a trustworthy choice for developers building applications that handle sensitive data, such as Protected Health Information (PHI).

#### <span class="pg-blue">‚ÑπÔ∏è API, Not a Full Tool</span>

Claude is an API, not an out-of-the-box IDE extension like Copilot. To use it, you must either build your own integration or use a third-party extension (like Continue.dev) that supports Claude. The privacy guarantees apply to the API endpoint, but you must also trust the extension you are using.

### Self-Hosted / Local-First

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 16px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
<div style="overflow: hidden;">
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;">
<img src="https://ollama.ai/public/ollama.png" alt="Ollama logo" width="128">
</div>
<div>
<p>For maximum privacy and control, nothing beats a <strong>self-hosted solution</strong>. This approach involves running an open-source AI model entirely on your own local machine or private server. Tools like <strong>Ollama</strong> and <strong>LM Studio</strong> make this incredibly accessible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
<a href="https://ollama.ai" style="display: inline-block; padding: 8px 16px; background-color: #4caf50; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; margin-right: 10px;">üè† Ollama Homepage</a>

<a href="https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby">‚ÑπÔ∏è TabbyML</a>
</div>
</div>

#### <span class="pg-green">‚úÖ Absolute Privacy and Data Control</span>

With a self-hosted setup, your code, prompts, and credentials **never leave your machine**. There is zero risk of third-party data collection, training, or leakage. You have full control over the model and the data flow. This is the only way to achieve a truly air-gapped AI coding experience.

#### <span class="pg-green">‚úÖ Fully Open Source and Customizable</span>

The entire stack, from the model runner (Ollama) to the IDE extensions (Continue.dev, TabbyML), is open-source. This provides full transparency into how the system works. You can inspect the code, customize it, and be certain there are no hidden data collection mechanisms.

#### <span class="pg-orange">‚ö†Ô∏è Performance and Hardware Dependent</span>

The major trade-off is performance. The speed and quality of responses depend entirely on your own hardware. While modern CPUs can run smaller models effectively, a powerful GPU (especially one with 8GB+ of VRAM) is highly recommended for a smooth experience with larger, more capable models.

#### <span class="pg-blue">‚ÑπÔ∏è Compliance is Your Responsibility</span>

Since you are running the entire system, you are responsible for your own compliance. This setup is inherently compliant with privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR because no data is transferred to a third-party processor.

description: "Exploring the privacy considerations when using AI coding assistants like Cursor, WindSurf, and Claude Code."
tags: [privacy, ai, development, coding]
---

As AI programming assistants become increasingly integrated into development workflows, it's crucial to understand their privacy implications. This post examines the privacy considerations when using tools like Cursor, WindSurf, and Claude Code.

## Data Collection and Usage

AI coding assistants collect various types of data to function effectively:

* Your source code and comments
* Project structure and file names
* Input/output patterns from your applications
* Dependencies and libraries used
* Command history and coding patterns

{% highlight markdown %}
// Example of what AI tools might process
function processUserData(userData) {
  const ssn = userData.socialSecurityNumber;
  const dob = userData.dateOfBirth;
  // Process sensitive information
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Key Privacy Concerns

### Code Exfiltration

AI tools typically send your code to cloud servers for processing, which raises several questions:

1. Is your proprietary code being used to train these models?
2. Could your code containing sensitive business logic be exposed?
3. Are you inadvertently sharing internal algorithms or security mechanisms?

### Sensitive Data Exposure

Developers often include sensitive information in code:

* API keys and secrets
* Database connection strings
* Testing credentials
* Customer data in comments or test cases

### Intellectual Property Concerns

When using AI programming assistants, you're potentially sharing your intellectual property with third parties. This raises several concerns:

1. **Terms of service** may grant these companies broad rights to use your code
2. **Algorithm copying** - Your unique algorithms could be incorporated into the model
3. **Competitive edge** - Proprietary techniques might benefit competitors using the same tools
4. **Licensing conflicts** - Code generated based on your input might create attribution issues

Most AI tool providers maintain they don't "own" your code, but their terms often include rights to analyze, store, and learn from your submissions.

## Privacy Features to Look For

When selecting an AI programming assistant, consider these privacy features:

* **Local processing options** - Can the model run locally without sending data externally?
* **Data retention policies** - How long is your code stored on their servers?
* **Anonymization** - Is your code properly anonymized before processing?
* **Selective sending** - Can you control what code gets sent for analysis?
* **Transparency** - Clear documentation about how your data is used

## Comparison of Popular Tools

| Data Retention   | Varies        | 30 days       | Undisclosed   |
| Open Source      | No            | Partially     | No            |
| Privacy Controls | Basic         | Advanced      | Moderate      |
| Opt-In           | 


## Best Practices for Privacy-Conscious Developers

1. **Use gitignore patterns** to prevent sharing sensitive files
2. **Remove API keys and credentials** before using AI assistants
3. **Consider local-first tools** when working with sensitive code
4. **Review privacy policies** before adoption
5. **Monitor network traffic** to understand what's being sent
6. **Use dedicated environments** for AI-assisted coding

## Conclusion

AI programming tools offer tremendous productivity benefits, but they come with significant privacy trade-offs. By understanding these implications and following best practices, developers can make informed decisions about which tools to use and how to configure them to protect sensitive information.

As these technologies evolve, it's essential to stay informed about privacy practices and advocate for stronger protections in the tools we rely on daily. -->
